# SDS-PAGE-ham-extracts
214 Lanes of SDS-PAGE data, from 19 Spanish and 18 French dry-cured hams.

Data matrix size [214 x 431], lanes arranged row-wise in the .csv file. Sample codes are: 'S(panish) 01 - 19' and 'F(rench) 01 - 18'. Each sample underwent duplicate extractions ('A' and 'B'), and each of these was used in three lanes in randomised gel locations. This gave ~6 lanes per sample (there were occasional missing/faulty lanes which have been excluded at the pre-processing stage). Headers in .csv file provide the descriptors.

The data are supplied pre-processed and aligned on the molccular weight scale as described in “Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins in dry-cured hams: Data registration and multivariate analysis across multiple gels”, Olias R. et. al., Electrophoresis 27 (7) 1288-1299.
